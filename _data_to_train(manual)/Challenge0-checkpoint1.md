> 🔥 We'll use burner wallets on localhost.

> 👛 Explore how burner wallets work in 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 by opening a new incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You'll notice it has a new wallet address in the top right. Copy the incognito browser's address and send localhost test funds to it from your first browser (using the **Faucet** button in the bottom left):

> 👨🏻‍🚒 When you close the incognito window, the account is gone forever. Burner wallets are great for local development but you'll move to more permanent wallets when you interact with public networks.
