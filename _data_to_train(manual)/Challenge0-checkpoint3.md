# 🚩 Challenge #0: 🎟 Simple NFT Example

## Checkpoint 3: 💾 Deploy your contract! 🛰

🛰 Ready to deploy to a public testnet?!?

> Change the defaultNetwork in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` to `sepolia`.

🔐 Generate a deployer address with `yarn generate`. This creates a unique deployer address and saves the mnemonic locally.

> This local account will deploy your contracts, allowing you to avoid entering a personal private key.

⛽️ You will need to send ETH to your deployer address with your wallet, or get it from a public faucet of your chosen network.

> Some popular faucets are [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and [https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia)

> ⚔️ Side Quest: Keep a 🧑‍🎤 [punkwallet.io](https://punkwallet.io) on your phone's home screen and keep it loaded with testnet eth. 🧙‍♂️ You'll look like a wizard when you can fund your deployer address from your phone in seconds.

🚀 Deploy your NFT smart contract with `yarn deploy`.

> 💬 Hint: You can set the `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.ts` to `sepolia` **OR** you can `yarn deploy --network sepolia`.
