## Checkpoint 4: 🚢 Ship your frontend! 🚁

> ✏️ Edit your frontend config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` to change the `targetNetwork` to `chains.sepolia` :

> You should see the correct network in the frontend (http://localhost:3000):

> 🦊 Since we have deployed to a public testnet, you will now need to connect using a wallet you own or use a burner wallet. By default 🔥 `burner wallets` are only available on `hardhat` . You can enable them on every chain by setting `onlyLocalBurnerWallet: false` in your frontend config (`scaffold.config.ts` in `packages/nextjs/`)

> 💬 Hint: For faster loading of your transfer page, consider updating the `fromBlock` passed to `useScaffoldEventHistory` in [`packages/nextjs/pages/transfers.tsx`](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/blob/c18ed9bd202b8614da6775a189937b4facb58929/packages/nextjs/pages/transfers.tsx#L11) to `blocknumber - 10` at which your contract was deployed. Example: `fromBlock: 3750241n` (where `n` represents its a [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)). To find this blocknumber, search your contract's address on Etherscan and find the `Contract Creation` transaction line.

🚀 Deploy your NextJS App

```shell
yarn vercel
```

> Follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. Once you log in (email, github, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

> If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run `yarn vercel --prod`. If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

⚠️ Run the automated testing function to make sure your app passes

```shell
yarn test
```

#### Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.
This is great to complete your **SpeedRunEthereum**.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

- 🔷`ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

- 📃`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` with your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> 💬 Hint: It's recommended to store env's for nextjs in Vercel/system env config for live apps and use .env.local for local testing.
